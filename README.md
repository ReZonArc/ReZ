# ReZ Enterprise

**ReZ Enterprise** represents the fusion of **ReZonance (ReZ)** and **Zone Enterprise (Zon)** with a focus on **Architecture (Arc)**, creating the innovative ReZonArc organizational methodology.

## Overview

ReZ Enterprise operates on a platform-centric organizational model that balances hierarchical efficiency with networked innovation, enabling autonomous yet connected organizational units to thrive in a VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) business environment.

## Organizational Blueprint

Our organizational structure is based on deep analysis of modern platform-centric models, featuring:

### Central Platform: ReZonance (ReZ)
The core platform providing shared services, infrastructure, and governance frameworks that enable all organizational units to operate efficiently while maintaining autonomy.

### Five Organizational Units

1. **Production Unit (Zone Enterprise - Zon)** - Hierarchical structure focused on operational excellence
2. **Research Unit (ReZonance - ReZ)** - Networked structure driving innovation and discovery
3. **Product Management Unit (Architecture - Arc)** - Networked structure providing strategic architecture
4. **Purchase Unit (Zone Enterprise - Zon)** - Hierarchical structure ensuring procurement excellence
5. **Marketing & Sales Unit (ReZonance - ReZ)** - Networked structure for market engagement

## Documentation
