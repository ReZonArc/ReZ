# ReZ Enterprise Organizational Blueprint

## Overview

ReZ Enterprise represents the fusion of **ReZonance (ReZ)** and **Zone Enterprise (Zon)** with a focus on **Architecture (Arc)**, creating the ReZonArc organizational methodology. This blueprint is based on a platform-centric organizational model that balances hierarchical efficiency with networked innovation.

## Platform-Centric Architecture

### Core Philosophy
ReZ Enterprise operates on a platform-centric model where the **ReZonance Org** serves as the central platform providing shared services, standards, and infrastructure to enable autonomous yet connected organizational units.
