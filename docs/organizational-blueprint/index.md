## Key Concepts

### Platform-Centric Model
A organizational approach where a central platform provides shared services and infrastructure, enabling autonomous business units to operate efficiently while maintaining integration.

### Hybrid Structure
Combines hierarchical efficiency (for operational units) with networked agility (for innovation units), optimizing both stability and adaptability.

### VUCA Adaptation
The organizational design specifically addresses Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous business environments through adaptive structures and platform capabilities.

### ReZonArc Fusion
The unique combination of:
- **ReZonance**: Platform effects and networked innovation
- **Zone Enterprise**: Operational excellence and efficiency
- **Architecture**: Systematic design and integration
